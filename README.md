# CCN Dragoncraft Reborn!

###  We did not create each mod in this modpack, Credits should go to the ORIGINAL Creator of the current mod!

 

## Please let me make crystal clear this is a aplha version and is a very early stage. we started working on this project about 10 hours ago. we will do our very best to keep this pack up to date and bug free. But please have patience!
 

 

*Dragonborn* aims to bring Minecraft´s Original "Survival" experience and adding the "RP" Event to the Game.

We are trying to create a "Non medieval" but still having mermaids,dragons etc. BUT not limiting it to this.
we are trying to keep things as vanilla as possible, but still this is custom minecraft for a reason (if you wanna play vanilla open the normal launcher lol)
FTBQuesting will be used to make our very own custom questline which should help players progress trough the diffrent stages of our modpack.
Our modpack will contain some of the following things but are not limited to:

 

1. In this modpack you will find some of the following things
2. Dragons (Should be self explained really)
3. Blue skies (Amazing Dimensions)
4. New quests, Gear, Mobs.
5. A whole set of custom made quests
6. Some custom UI Tweaks.
7.Waystones
8. (Better end - Better Dungeons- Better Nether- Almost every mod from him really)
9. Biomes o plenty

In total this mod contains 82 mods (currently with API´s)




 A ton of custom Mobs from curseforge (as you can see below at the bottum of the page.)
